This project was built during a week-long competition organized by Makers and Robotics Club at Bucknell University. The event was sponsored by KEEN (Kern Entrepreneurship Education Network).

We designed and built a Mars Rover using an Arduino, chassis, IR sensor and servo, among other circuit components. Our robot successfully dodged all components within specific boundaries and made past the finish line in second to best timing.
